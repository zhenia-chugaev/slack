### CI/CD status:
[![Actions Status](https://github.com/anorone/frontend-project-12/actions/workflows/hexlet-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/anorone/frontend-project-12/actions)

The application is accessible under the following [link](https://slack-n2rr.onrender.com/). Alternatively you can browse this [demo](https://frontend-chat-ru.hexlet.app/).

## Limitations
Due to limitations of [web hosting service](https://render.com/) used for deploying the application you can encounter a problem accessing it using the link above.

> Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving incoming traffic. Render spins the service back up whenever it next receives a request to process. Spinning up a service takes up to a minute, which causes a noticeable delay for incoming requests until the service is back up and running. For example, a browser page load will hang temporarily.

If you are experiencing such a problem you can either wait for the application to load or explore in the meanwhile the demonstration project that owns all the same features that the original application.
